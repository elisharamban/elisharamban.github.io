## How did it go?

Overall I would say it went pretty well (and why should'nt it). We don't share common interests, I'm interested in Silicon Valley, AI, Futurisim etc. (SSC\ACT) whike she is interested in medicine, cooking and helping others (not to worry - this is also on the list but not something I place as a top priority discussion-wise). She is a charming person, lovely discussion, nice time, looks nice (I still don't know how to evaluate this for a number of reasons:1. I haven't met others to compare 2. Maybe my level of being anamord by someone is pretty low and most people fit this critiria) Edit: She is short. I do like her, but I'm still scared of making the wrong decision, does liking a person although you think differently make a huge difference or not? How many other people out there like her (Compassionate, Positive - I'm somewhat of a pessimist so it can be a huge edvantage the YS as well - , Caring, Yirat Shamayim - is contagious, Midot) are there? Sadly, for now, I'll give it a 4.


## The Second Time 

(Took place: 29/3 Time of writing: 31/3 1:10 AM)

This one was four hours long and was pretty enjoyable too. This time we took off our masks, but to my dismay I didn't feel any attraction whats so ever (maybe ever so slightly) to her. To be clear: She isn't ugly, but I don't feel a physical connection. It was like having an enjoyable conversation with a friend, nothing over the top. [I messed up the end after declining to eat over by them because of my thought that this would give over a false impression on where things stood at that moment]. We disscussed: Godel/Mathematics/The role of Rabanim in my life/The meta level - Steel-manning etc./Me being unhappy with my ideas and not feeling whole with myself about my decision of persuing the Truth (as percived by me) no matter the consequences for myself and from the community with who I interact with/Friends/Tidy VS. Messy life style/The internet/...
It seems like some of my earlier concerns are worked out, but new concerns have risen as well. Akiva said that if I'm interested in meeting again I should do so with hope that feelings of attractiveness may change in the future. In addition he recommended  the dating to be with a goal of having a friendship (and not only the she fits my criteria). This indeed may take many more dates, only after the 4th/5th etc. does this occur. This is more of a modern style of dating, who knows what the other party expectes. Much more, alas it is 1:24
