## How did it go?

Overall I would say it went pretty well (and why should'nt it). We don't share common interests, I'm interested in Silicon Valley, AI, Futurisim etc. (SSC\ACT) whike she is interested in medicine, cooking and helping others (not to worry - this is also on the list but not something I place as a top priority discussion-wise). She is a charming person, lovely discussion, nice time, looks nice (I still don't know how to evaluate this for a number of reasons:1. I haven't met others to compare 2. Maybe my level of being anamord by someone is pretty low and most people fit this critiria) Edit: She is short. I do like her, but I'm still scared of making the wrong decision, does liking a person although you think differently make a huge difference or not? How many other people out there like her (Compassionate, Positive - I'm somewhat of a pessimist so it can be a huge edvantage the YS as well - , Caring, Yirat Shamayim - is contagious, Midot) are there? Sadly, for now, I'll give it a 4.
