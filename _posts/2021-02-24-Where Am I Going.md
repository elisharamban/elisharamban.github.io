I have a constant feeling that I am not in control. Sometimes it's really depressing - like right now - other times it's a very light feeling of hopelessness. The point is that's it's always there, ever present.Â 
The roots of the position that I find myself in is due partly to my inability to actually extract myself from it, which is my own disastrous fault.

(Two weeks later)
I feel that I'm not in a position to complain, for a number of reasons:
1.We're about to move in to this huge mansion, I am also the wealthiest person I know personally. From  material perspective I have all I need.
2.I myself have a large number of (unrealized) capabilities.
3.I am currently learning about the secrets of the universe (high-level mathematics). I can think freely about life and existence itself. My only Real drawback is my own understanding (i.e. I wish I had a higher IQ level).
Still, I feel alone and with no purpose. I feel I'm being forced to do what I am currently doing ==> lack motivation (hey, I'm writing to you instead of actually preparing for my math exam in two weeks). I don't need to justify myself inorder to feel the way I'm feeling.
I only need the courage to leap out of this, but to where? (Elisha-Of-The-Future-Where-Everyting-Is-Good please tell me, what should I do??)
