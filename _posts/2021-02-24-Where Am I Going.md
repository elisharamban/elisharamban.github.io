I have a constant feeling that I am not in control. Sometimes it's really depressing - like right now - other times it's a very light feeling of hopelessness. The point is that's it's always there, ever present. 
The roots of the position that I find myself in is due partly to my inability to actually extract myself from it which is my own disastrous fault.
