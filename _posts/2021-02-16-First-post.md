## A New Post

Well well well let's see where this goes.

Okay. 2:57 pm. 
I am writing this only a few hours after I completed my exam in Linear Algebra. It didn't go aswell as I expected which means I may need to redo the course which is a huge bummer. To balance things out, I just checked my email to dicover that I passed my set theory exam - what a relief.
Set Theory was defenitly interesting, by interesting I don't mean that there were interesting equations, far far from it. The interesting part was [Cantor's theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor) about infinity. The theoretical ideas that were discussed _were_ fascinating.   
See [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMgiOfmMqHg) for an initial taste of the subject.
