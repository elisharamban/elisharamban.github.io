## A New Post (one counting to infinity)

[Thanks to [him](https://guzey.com/personal/why-have-a-blog/#how-to-start-a-blog)]

Well well well let's see where this goes.
Scott claims that his number one tip for writing well is "just transcribe your thoughts - as is - on paper". I will take this piece of advice as literal as possible - the consequences may tearn out to be pretty sloppy.

Okay. 2:57 p.m. 
I am writing this only a few hours after I completed my exam in Linear Algebra. It didn't go as well as I expected which means I may need to redo the course which is a huge bummer. To balance things out, I just checked my email to dicover that I passed my set theory exam - what a relief.
{Edit 2/3/21 1:28 a.m.: I narrowly passed my exam in L.A. who knows how much work those few points aleviated me from Hurray :)}

Set Theory was defenitly interesting, by interesting I don't mean that the equations were interesting, far far from it. The interesting part was [Cantor's theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor) about infinity. The theoretical ideas that were discussed _were_ fascinating.   
To my understanding the most basic principle that Cantor introduced was that of counting. Sounds trivial, but it conceales in its wake some earth-shattering consequences. Simply put, Cantor said that if we were interested in counting two piles - say apples - in order to determine which of the two was larger, or were they in fact equall. The way to do this is not by counting both piles and then comparing the amount, rather we would pair up elements from both groups and 

See [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMgiOfmMqHg) for an initial taste of the subject, and [here](https://gadial.net/categories/set%20theory/) for a much more thorough understanding of the subject - which is much recommended.
